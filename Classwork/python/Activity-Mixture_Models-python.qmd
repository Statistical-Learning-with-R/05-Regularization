# **Try it!**

## **Recall: We wanted to predict the Type of cannabis from the descriptor words.**

## **Consider only Indica vs. Sativa (no Hybrid)**

## **Can you combine logistic regression with LASSO to tell me which words best separate Indica and Sativa?**

## **How does this compare to what you find with a decision tree?**


```{python}

cann = pd.read_csv("https://www.dropbox.com/s/s2a1uoiegitupjc/cannabis_full.csv?dl=1")

cann["Type"] = cann["Type"].astype("category")
cann = cann.dropna() 

cann = cann.drop(columns = ["Strain", "Effects", "Flavor", "Dry", "Mouth"])

cann_X = cann.drop(columns = ["Type"])

```
